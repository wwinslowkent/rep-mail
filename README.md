# README

This is a crowd sourced app where users can look up their congressmen and view bills going through the house and senate.  The goal is to provide a forum where people can post messages about bills that other users can use as a jumping off point for their own correspondence. Each message posted on a bill has links where users can click through to their congressman's contact page.

Currently populated with congressmen from Vermont only.
